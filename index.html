                    <b>Right Here! Right Now!</b> is the third project in the course <b>CS 424: Visualization and Visual Analytics</b>under Prof. Andrew Johnson at University of Illinois at Chicago(UIC). The project is continuation of the ongoing focus of the class on demographics and communities in Chicago, Illinois. Project 3 is called Right Here! Right Now! as our primary focus this time is 311 Data offered by the City of Chicago alongside public transit systems available to the public and how to efficiently show that data to the user and let the user filter information from it. 
                    <br>

                   <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <p>
                    <b>Right Here! Right Now!</b> is the third project in the CS 424 : Visualization and Visual Analytics course at University of Illinois at Chicago(UIC). The focus of the project is to make an interactive application displaying the 311 data available from city of Chicago and also the various transit systems like CTA Bus System and Divvy Bike Sharing System.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The goal of the project was to create an application which can be used by an user to travel through and discover Chicago in the best possible way. To aid the user to make decisions, we give the user various types of relevant data. The data is split into various layers which can be toggled on and off so that the user always has the control over what he/she wants to explore. The Layers on our application are various types of 311 data, Divvy Bike Stations and CTA Tracker. We wanted to give the user the option of not only able to decide if his/her interests but also discover new places of interest. Along with the various points of interest, We wanted to give the user option of seeing the various public transit systems around his point of interest. <br>Listed below are the various types of views the user can show from.
                    <br>
                    <uL><b> Various Types of 311 Data </b>
                    <li> Crime Commited </li>

                        <li> Package Goods</li>
                        <li> Public Garage</li>
                        <li> Public Place of Amusement</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul> Other Information
                        <li> Current Weather</li>
                        <li> Sunrise and Sunset Functionality</li>
                        <li> Current Time </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                    At the same time, the user may or may not care about overall city of Chicago and may be concerned about seeing information only in a certain community/neighbourhood of Chicago or maybe want to check whats available near by. For this specific purpose, We have incorporated various modes in our application. The user can choose to view information of the below given modes.
                    <ul>Modes
                        <li>Path Mode</li>
                            <p> The user picks his start and ending destination points and we give the user the route along major streets. We have designed the application in such a manner that the user can even choose the path he/she wants to take by simply dragging the path and it automatically routes to the new route. To keep the data relevant, we have chosen a 2 block radius to show data along the path created. This way the user can know whether that particular route is safe or not and can actually compare between routes.</p>
                        <li>Box Mode</li>
                            <p> The user picks two points and the user will be able to see data in the selected box. The boundary shows the selected region. This allows the user to see data in a much larger area and see what is around and about.</p>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Along with the different layers, we have visualizations for all the 311 data which allows the user to quickly see if the statistics of the selected area versus the statistics of city of chicago. The visualizations are broken down into last week and last month so that the user can see a trend between different times and between the area and the city itself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We have tried to create the application from an user's point of view and tried to incorporate things which would help the user navigate and discover new points of interest and in general give the user a sense of how the city is in the selected area. 311 data is a big deal in Chicago and it being public is a huge plus. Through our application , we hope that users have a more usable and friendly interface to access this and discover this beautiful city of Chicago.

                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p3.png"/>
                <p>[path routed to see the update window]</p>
                <p>This is the update window. This is where the updates on the data show up as they are reflected in the map.</p>

                <p>This is the sidebar which lets you show/hide the control panel and the chart view box. You can also use it to zoom in/out on the map and, clear any selections previously made and, press the "?" button for help.</p>
                
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p6.png"/>
                <p>Right under the Weather Box display, you are able to access the twitter module</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Press the "Twitter Data" button. This will open up a dropdown with the 15 latest relevant tweets.</li>
                    <li>Each tab shows the 5 latest tweets for Crime, 311 and, Food, separately</li>

                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p7.png"/>
                <p>There are two ways to display the information from the various layers Firstly, as shown above, the user can choose to display layer information within a user-constricted area. The steps to do so are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose Marker 1</li>
                    <li>Choose Marker 2</li>
                    <li>Press the "Draw a Box" button to geographically restrict information displayed to the selected area.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p8.png"/>
                <p>Secondly, as shown above, the user can choose to display layer information within a 2 block radius of the path generated by the Leaflet Routing Machine between two user inputted markers. The steps to do so are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose Marker 1</li>
                    <li>Choose Marker 2</li>
                    <li>Press the "Draw a Path" button to geographically restrict information displayed around the path generated by the Leaflet Routing Machine</li>
                </ol>
                
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p9.png"/>
                <p>Additionally, for the path implementation of the application, because the Leaflet Routing Machine creates a path between two user defined points automatically, the application also lets the user re-route according to their preferences. The user may, for example, want to avoid certain areas that according to the map, have higher crime activity. The way to do so is:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Drag the route to wherever you would like to reroute through</li>
                    <li>Press the "Update Route button" to update the data being displayed</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>LAYER CONTROL:</h3>
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Reported Potholes</p>
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p10.png"/>
                <p>The first layer, the one that is toggled on by default is the one for "Reported Potholes." This displays the reported potholes within the confined box (as shown above) or, around a drawn path. The layer displays 2 variations of the icon to let the user distinguish between potholes reported within the last 2 weeks vs. those reported in the last month.</p>
                
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p11.png"/>
                <ol>
                    <li>The pothole icon with the red trimming marks potholes reported within the last 2 weeks.</li>
                    <li>The pothole icon with the black trimming marks potholes reported within the last month.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p12.png"/>
                <p>Every marker has information about the pothole bound to it. On clicking on a mapped icon, a popup specifies:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Date (when the pothole was reported)</li>
                    <li>Status (whether or not the inquiry has been completed)</li>
                    <li>Message to user regarding whether or not the pothole has been filled</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Recent Crimes</p>
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p13.png"/>
                <p>The "Recent Crimes" layer, when toggled ON, displays the reported crimes within the confined box (as shown above) or, around a drawn path.</p>
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p14.png"/>
                <p>The layer displays 2 variations of the icon to let the user distinguish between crimes reported within the last 2 weeks vs. those reported in the last month.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The crimes icon with the black trimming marks recent crimes reported within the last month</li>
                    <li>The crimes icon with the red trimming marks recent crimes reported within the last 2 weeks</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="images/how-to-pics/p15.png"/>
                <p>Every marker has information about the crime bound to it. On clicking on a mapped icon, a popup displays:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Date Reported (when the crime was reported)</li>
                    <li>Description (The primary description of the crime, as it was reported)</li>

                    <li>The Hamlin Park / North Center area (from Belmont to Montrose between Western and Ashland) seems to be one of the few areas in the city that excells at keeping their streetlights on:<br />

                    <li>Crime reports are much more evenly distributed around the city than we expected them to be.  From believing the accepted stereotypes, we would expect crime to be much worse in certain areas than others, but that does not seem to be the case:<br />

	              <h3>Soda API</h3>
                <p> Soda API is the API for all the 311 data being used for this project. Each layer had to be shown on the map and had to be sub-divided on the basis of two different times- last week and last month which made sense as it had to be relevant to the user using the application. Along with showing data subdivided based on time, each marker on the map also shows various tidbits on each layer.
                </p>

                The objective of the project was to display the Following are the data sources which are being fulled using Soda API.

                <p>
                The Weather Data is being sourced from Weather Undeground and we are using the API with current location as Chicago and the temperature is shown in Fahrenheit. We have also shown the Weather images besides the temperature itself to give a more visual feel to the user. People respond better to images and can relate better to the weather if they have weather icons alongside the temperature. The icons take into account the time and even the sunset and sunrise timings when bringing up the icons.

                <h3>Jason Mayes Twitter API</h3>
                <p>
                We have utilized Jason Mayes Twitter API to show data for three hashtags :<br>
                <ul>
                <li>#Chicago #Crime</li>
                <li>#Chicago #Food</li>
                <li>#Chicago #311</li>
                </ul>
                  <p>
                  This has been achieved through creating twitter widgets and calling the API to show data for each hashtag. We can show and hide images but we choose not to show images because of size constraints. The API also allows us to reply, retweet and make tweets as favorites if the user has logged into his/her twitter account. The API allows us to do that straight from the application itself. Also, we limited the application to show the top 5 tweets at a time as we are not allowed to scroll.

                  <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
                  <p>
                  The beauty of using Javascript and its respective libraries is that no extra tools or utilities or any huge integrated development environment is needed to run our project. 
                  <br /><br />
                  There is some work done on the server side, but because this application requires internet access regardless, we let our server do that work for you.  Of course, if you want to see the work that our server does or interact with it, you can look at the included app.py file which is a simple cherrypy appliction.
                  <br /><br />
                  Of course, if all you want to do is download and run the application, you can do that with no trouble!  Please follow the following steps to go from start to set. 
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li> Please read the how to use page for getting the best out of the application.</li>
                  <li> Download the application by running:<br /><br />
                       <code>git clone https://github.com/trustdarkness/righthererightnow.git</code><br /></li>
                  <li> Then cd into the project directory (usually righthererightnow) and type:<br /><br />
                       <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code><br /></li>
                  <li> You can now access the application on your local machine at<br /><br />
                       http://localhost:8000</li>

                  <li>  Although the application would run in any modern web browser, We recommend that latest version of Google Chrome should be used to run the application. You can download Chrome <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/index.html"><b>here</b></a></li>  
                  </ol>
